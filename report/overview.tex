A state $q$ is represented by a 4-tuple $<t, m, b, c>$ where $t, m, b, c\in \{0, 1, 2\}$; $t$, $m$, and $b$ represent the degrees of the top, middle, and bottom (respectively) of the rightmost vertices of the input so far; and $c$ represents ``closure'' information, which we describe below.

We will enumerate the states of interest in a TABLE.
