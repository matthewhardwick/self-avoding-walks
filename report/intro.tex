Counting the number of self-avoiding walks in a hypercubic lattice is an open problem in combinatorics. This has APPLICATIONS... Previous work in this area utilized finite automata to count walks beginning at the origin in a $d$-dimensional hypercubic lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$, an infinite space~\cite{ponitz:walks:ejc:2000}. 

In this report, we solve the simpler problem of identifying self-avoiding walks in a restricted (finite) lattice of size $3\times n$ for finite $n$. We develop a method for encoding the lattice as input to a finite automaton, and design the automaton that recognizes self-avoiding walks over this input. We illustrate the correctness of the automaton with several test cases.
