\label{sec:statement}

In graph theory, a \emph{walk} is a sequence of edges connected by vertices. A \emph{self-avoiding walk} is one that can be traced from start to finish without tracing over the same vertex more than once. Put another way, the a walk $w$ is self-avoiding if $w$ does not have any self loops.

A finite automaton can be used to process the set of edges $3\times n$ square lattice. We develop a set of symbols that can be used to encode any such lattice; this symbol set constitutes the input alphabet of the finite automaton that recognizes lattices that contain a self-avoiding walk.

This finite automata accepts $3\times n$ square lattices that meet the following criteria:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The edges of the lattice represent a self-avoiding walk.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Walks in the lattice do not \emph{jump}. That is, there are exactly two ends, or vertices of degree 1.
\item Walks in the lattice do not \emph{branch}. That is, no vertex has degree greater than 2.
\item There is no \emph{closed loop} in the lattice.
\end{enumerate}
\item A walk begins at the origin (the leftmost, bottom point) of the lattice. This condition not only simplifies the design of the automaton, but also ensures that if the automaton is used to count self-avoiding walks, double-counting the horizontal translations or vertical reflections of the same walk is avoided.
\end{enumerate}
