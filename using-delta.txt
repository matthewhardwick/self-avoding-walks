The delta function given in delta-algorithm.txt works for transitions from 
states that have numbers for t, m, b, and c. It does not handle the 'start',
'trivial', or 'reject' states.

From the start state, there are four legal input symbols (others lead to the
'reject' state), which are listed below. They transition to numbered states, 
and from those onward, the delta algorithm may be used.
(q=start, a=00000) => q'=0010 
(q=start, a=00010) => q'=0120
(q=start, a=01000) => q'=1112
(q=start, a=01010) => q'=1220

From the trivial state, there is a self-loop on trivial input (a=00000), and a 
transition to the reject state on all other inputs.

The reject state is dead.
